# 3D Animated Portfolio

This project is a 3D animated portfolio developed using **ReactJS**, **React Three Fiber**, and **GSAP**, along with animations powered by **Adobe Mixamo** and 3D models from **Ready Player Me** and **Sketchfab**. It showcases my web development skills through an interactive 3D experience.

## Features

- **3D Avatar**: Created with Ready Player Me for a personalized virtual representation.
- **Custom Animations**: Powered by Adobe Mixamo for lifelike character movements.
- **Smooth Animations with GSAP**: GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) is used to create fluid animations and transitions for enhanced user experience.
- **Interactive 3D Elements**: React Three Fiber brings 3D models and environments into the portfolio.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Content**: Showcases projects, skills, and contact details with interactive elements.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: Core framework for building the frontend.
- **React Three Fiber**: Simplifies the integration of 3D elements in React.
- **Three.js**: Enables rendering and creation of 3D scenes in the browser.
